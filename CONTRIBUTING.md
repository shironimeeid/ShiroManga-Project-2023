- Whether you have to implement new feature, please, open an issue or discussion regarding it to ensure it will be accepted.
- Translations have to be managed using the [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/kotatsu/) platform.
- In case you want to add a new manga source, refer to the [parsers repository](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers).

Refactoring or some dev-faces improvements are also might be accepted, however please stick to the following principles:

- Please, do not modify readme and other information files (except for typos).
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless required. APK size is important.
